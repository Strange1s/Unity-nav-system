# navManagerForUnity
A navigation manager for unity that allows the player to be guided to locations based on missions. WIP

THIS CURRENT VERSION ONLY WORKS FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONS, IF YOU HAVE A CONTINOUS LOOP MAP OR A MAP THAT HAS A DEFINED START AND END!, AND MAY NEED SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO WORK BETTER!

NOT RECOMMENDED FOR OPEN WORLD GAMES, IT MOST LIKELY WILL NOT WORK!!

The current version here is designed for a map similar to that of the simpsons hit and run and should work for maps like that. If you need to split your map for whatever reason then use two of the manager script and have one reference the other, this will allow the scripts to run perfectly together
